## Unreleased

A production-readiness pass. No new features; it fixes packaging, security, and tooling
defects that made the previous release unsafe to publish or depend on.

### `npm publish` would have failed outright

`@10xscale/agentflow-client` is a scoped package, and npm defaults scoped packages to
`restricted` access. Without `publishConfig.access: "public"` in `package.json`, the
publish is rejected by the registry. That field was missing, so the package could not have
been published to the public registry at all. Added, together with `provenance: true`.

### The build did not work on Windows

`npm run build` ended with:

```
tsc && vite build && cp -r dist-types/* dist/
```

`cp` is not a Windows command, so any contributor on Windows could not build the package.
The build now emits declarations straight into `dist/` through a dedicated
`tsconfig.build.json`, and the copy step is gone entirely. There is also a subtle hazard
this removes: `vite build` empties its `outDir` by default, so with the steps in the other
order it would have deleted the declarations `tsc` had just written.

### Shipped sourcemaps pointed at nothing

The published tarball contained 41 `.map` files but no sources, so every sourcemap
referenced files the consumer never received. Debugging into the library gave you nothing
useful. `src/` is now included in the package, so the maps resolve.

### The types forced `@types/node` on browser consumers

`forgetMemories` annotated its timeout handle as `NodeJS.Timeout`. That namespace comes
from `@types/node`, so consumers building for the browser had to install Node typings to
compile against this package. Changed to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`, which is
portable. `Error.captureStackTrace` is now accessed structurally for the same reason.

**Upgrade note:** if you added `@types/node` solely to satisfy this package, you can
probably drop it.

### 11 vulnerabilities cleared

vitest 1.x and vite 5.x carried 11 advisories between them, 3 critical and 5 high.
Upgraded to vitest 3 and vite 7. `npm audit` now reports zero vulnerabilities.

### Dead code removed

Three unexported, unreferenced things were being bundled into every published build:
`makeSingleStreamCall` in `endpoints/stream.ts`, and `isRemoteToolCallChunk` plus
`REMOTE_TOOL_CALL_REASON` in `endpoints/wsStream.ts`. Also removed `check.ts` (a scratch
script importing from a path that does not exist) and `.npmignore` (dead configuration -
`files` in `package.json` takes precedence, so it had no effect).

None of these were exported, so nothing in your code can break.

### Tests are now type-checked

`tsconfig.json` covered only `src/`, so the test suite was never type-checked. Turning it
on surfaced six genuine type errors, all fixed. Separately, converting the codebase's
twelve `@ts-ignore` comments to `@ts-expect-error` proved that every one of them was
suppressing nothing at all; all twelve are gone.

### Tooling added

- ESLint 9 and Prettier, with the 93 pre-existing errors fixed rather than suppressed.
- CI on Node 18, 20, and 22, which verifies every declared entry point exists in the real
  tarball and smoke-tests both the CJS and ESM entry points from a clean install.
- Release workflow gated on CI with a tag-vs-version check, CodeQL, and Dependabot.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, issue forms, and
  a pull request template.

### Coverage numbers moved

Thresholds are now 72% lines/statements, 82% branches, 76% functions, pinned just under
the measured values as a ratchet. These read lower than the previous config's 75/60/75/75
claim, but nothing about the tests changed - vitest 3 remaps v8 coverage more accurately
than vitest 1 did, so the older figure was simply optimistic.

### Upgrading

```bash
npm install @10xscale/agentflow-client@latest
```

No code changes required.
